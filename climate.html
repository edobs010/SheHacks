<h1>Climate change matters!</h1>
<hr>

<h3>What is climate change?</h3>
<p>
	- Climate change includes major changes in temperature, precipitation, or wind patterns that occur over several decades or longer.
</p>	
<hr>

<h3>What is my effect?</h3>
<p>
	- Through one’s use of travel, one’s home, how much one wastes, etc. we all create carbon emissions which make-up our carbon footprint. 
</p>
<hr>

<h3>What is a carbon footprint?</h3>
<p>
	- A carbon footprint is the total amount of greenhouse gas emissions that come from the production, use and disposal of a product or service. It includes carbon dioxide -- the gas most commonly emitted by living beings, including methane, nitrous oxide, and fluorinated gases -- which trap heat in the atmosphere, causing global warming
	<br>
	- The bulk of a carbon footprint is caused by transportation, housing and food

<h3>How can I reduce my carbon footprint? Try these tips!</h3>
<p>
	- Drive less! In November 2017, carbon dioxide emissions from transportation surpassed emissions from electricity generation. Try taking a train, bus or even better, ride your bike! Bike rides are healthy for the climate’s health and yours! If you need to use your car, try carpooling, ensure your car is serviced regularly, cut down on your use of air conditioning as much as possible, use cruise control on long drives, and there are many others!
	<br>
	- Eat less meat! The production of red meat uses a lot of feed, water and land. Red meat can have up to 100 times the environmental impact of plant based food
	<br>
	- Eat local! Fewer food miles can mean fewer emissions.
	<br>
	- Waste less! Ensure to check the expiry dates of your groceries. If approaching an expiry date, try freezing your items. 
	<br>
	- In your home, turn down your heat, turn off lights and appliances when not in use, use LED lights, and choose renewables!
	<br>
	- Be conscious of what you buy and donate what you no longer buy!

<h3>Facts you need to know!</h3>
<p>
	- 2019 was the second warmest year on record
	NASA data show that average global temperatures in 2019 were 0.98 degrees C warmer than the 20th century average. In fact, the five warmest years in the 1880–2019 record have all occurred since 2015
	<br>
	- 11% of all global greenhouse gas emissions caused by humans are due to deforestation. This is comparable to the emissions from all of the passenger vehicles on the planet.
	<br>
	- Tropical forests are incredibly effective at storing carbon, providing at least 1/3 of the mitigation action needed to prevent the worst climate change scenarios. Yet nature-based solutions receive only 3% of all climate funding.
	<br>
	- Natural climate solutions such as restoring degraded forests could create as many as 39 jobs per million dollars spent — that's a job-creation rate more than six times higher than the oil and gas industry. 
	<br>
	- The concentration of carbon dioxide (CO2)​​​​​​​ in our atmosphere, as of May 2020, is the highest it has been in human history.
